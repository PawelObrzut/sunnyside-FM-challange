# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a completed challenge from - [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I hope you find my solution robust. 
## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Building your project

I built the project without frameworks. It is vanilla javascript, css and html.

## Deploying your project

I do not deploy it because the project is simple. It was front-end skills practice for me. I improved my layout skills using flexbox and grid and rensponsive design techniques.


## Sharing my solution

Feel free to clone this repo. To see the finished project simply open index.html in the browser.

## Got feedback for us?

I would like to hear comments from you saying what I could have done better.
